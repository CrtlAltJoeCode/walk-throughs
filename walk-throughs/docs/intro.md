# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover what's cool about documentation here with learning to build a repo for sharing information, blog posts, etc.  **Reachout or connect on Social Media**.

## Getting Started

We are starting a group of like minded folks interested in infosec and like to stream, hack....you know....all the security stuff and more!

### What you'll need

- Time
- Computer (If you want to have fun)
- Hacker Mindset
- a Drink
- ...or at least two from the above

## What we're working on


### Discord community

We hope to have enough people join a community for a safe learning environment. The idea is to create the colaborative space for individuals to express themselves and freely be able to share new techniques, tools, skill-set, etc.
